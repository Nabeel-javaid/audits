## About Mprofy
Mprofy DAO is a decentralized platform designed to empower the existing Mprofy community, facilitating their transition from Web2 to Web3. The DAO enables users to actively participate in the governance of the platform by voting on and submitting proposals. If a proposal is approved, it can receive funding from the Mprofy treasury, which holds a variety of crypto assets such as USDT, DAI, WETH, WBTC, and more. These assets are commissions earned by Mprofy users and contributed to the treasury. Additionally, the treasury includes the Deed token, Mprofy's native platform token, further driving the ecosystem's growth and sustainability.



## Risk classification

| Severity           | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :----------------- | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Likelihood: High   |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| Likelihood: Medium |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
| Likelihood: Low    |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

### Impact

- **High** - leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.
- **Medium** - only a small amount of funds can be lost (such as leakage of value) or a core functionality of the protocol is affected.
- **Low** - can lead to any kind of unexpected behaviour with some of the protocol's functionalities that's not so critical.

### Likelihood

- **High** - attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions and the cost of the attack is relatively low to the amount of funds that can be stolen or lost.
- **Medium** - only conditionally incentivized attack vector, but still relatively likely.
- **Low** - has too many or too unlikely assumptions or requires a huge stake by the attacker with little or no incentive.

### Actions required by severity level

- **High** - client **must** fix the issue.
- **Medium** - client **should** fix the issue.
- **Low** - client **could** fix the issue.

# Findings

## High severity

### [H-01] Excessive Proposal Fee sent by user is lost

#### Description:
In the `createProposal()` function, the requirement is that users send a minimum fee of `CREATE_PROPOSAL_COST` to create a proposal. However, if a user sends more than the required fee there is no advantage of it and, the excess amount is not refunded. This could lead to user may unintentionally overpay without being refunded.

```solidity
require(
    msg.value >= CREATE_PROPOSAL_COST,
    "Amount too low for creating proposal"
);
```

There is no logic to handle cases where the user sends more than `CREATE_PROPOSAL_COST`. As a result, any excess ETH sent is effectively "lost" to the contract.

#### Recommendation:
Introduce a logic to refund the excess ETH amount back to the user if they send more than the required proposal creation fee.


```solidity
require(
    msg.value >= CREATE_PROPOSAL_COST,
    "Amount too low for creating proposal"
);

// If user sends more than the required fee, refund the excess
uint excessAmount = msg.value - CREATE_PROPOSAL_COST;
if (excessAmount > 0) {
    payable(msg.sender).call{value: excessAmount}(""); // Refund excess

}
```

This way, users will only be charged the exact amount needed to create the proposal, and any extra ETH sent will be safely refunded to their wallet.

#### Resolution:
