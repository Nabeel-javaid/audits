## About Mprofy
Mprofy DAO is a decentralized platform designed to empower the existing Mprofy community, facilitating their transition from Web2 to Web3. The DAO enables users to actively participate in the governance of the platform by voting on and submitting proposals. If a proposal is approved, it can receive funding from the Mprofy treasury, which holds a variety of crypto assets such as USDT, DAI, WETH, WBTC, and more. These assets are commissions earned by Mprofy users and contributed to the treasury. Additionally, the treasury includes the Deed token, Mprofy's native platform token, further driving the ecosystem's growth and sustainability.



## Risk classification

| Severity           | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :----------------- | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Likelihood: High   |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| Likelihood: Medium |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
| Likelihood: Low    |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

### Impact

- **High** - leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.
- **Medium** - only a small amount of funds can be lost (such as leakage of value) or a core functionality of the protocol is affected.
- **Low** - can lead to any kind of unexpected behaviour with some of the protocol's functionalities that's not so critical.

### Likelihood

- **High** - attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions and the cost of the attack is relatively low to the amount of funds that can be stolen or lost.
- **Medium** - only conditionally incentivized attack vector, but still relatively likely.
- **Low** - has too many or too unlikely assumptions or requires a huge stake by the attacker with little or no incentive.

### Actions required by severity level

- **High** - client **must** fix the issue.
- **Medium** - client **should** fix the issue.
- **Low** - client **could** fix the issue.

# **Issue: Unsafe ERC20 Token Transfers Using `.call()`**

## **Overview**
In Solidity, using `.call()` to transfer ERC20 tokens is **not recommended** because it can fail for **non-standard ERC20 tokens** like USDT, BNB, and MKR. Some ERC20 tokens do not return a boolean (`true`) on `transfer()`, causing `.call()` to fail unexpectedly.  

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory data) = address(token).call(
    abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, tbalance)
);
if (!success || (data.length != 0 && !abi.decode(data, (bool)))) {
    revert TransferFailed();
}
```
✅ **Works for standard ERC20 tokens.**  
❌ **Fails for non-compliant tokens like USDT because they do not return `true`.**  

---

## **Why `.call()` is Problematic?**
1. **Non-Standard ERC20 Behavior**  
   - Some tokens do not return a boolean (`true`) on `transfer()`.
   - `.call()` expects a return value and fails if the token does not provide it.

2. **Lack of Compatibility with Certain ERC20 Tokens**  
   - Tokens like **USDT, MKR, and BNB** do not strictly adhere to ERC20’s expected `transfer()` return value.
   - `.call()` will **fail on these tokens**.


### **Recommended Fix:**
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

function withdrawStuckTokens(address token, address to) external onlyOwner {
    require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient");

    uint256 tbalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(tbalance > 0, "No token balance");

    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(token), to, tbalance);
}
```
