# GELT Security Review

A security review of the Gelt smart contract protocol was done by [0xepley](https://twitter.com/0xepley). \
This audit report includes all the vulnerabilities, issues and code improvements found during the security review.


## Disclaimer

"Audits are a time, resource and expertise bound effort where trained experts evaluate smart
contracts using a combination of automated and manual techniques to find as many vulnerabilities
as possible. Audits can show the presence of vulnerabilities **but not their absence**."

## Risk classification

| Severity           | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :----------------- | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Likelihood: High   |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| Likelihood: Medium |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
| Likelihood: Low    |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

### Impact

- **High** - leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.
- **Medium** - only a small amount of funds can be lost (such as leakage of value) or a core functionality of the protocol is affected.
- **Low** - can lead to any kind of unexpected behaviour with some of the protocol's functionalities that's not so critical.

### Likelihood

- **High** - attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions and the cost of the attack is relatively low to the amount of funds that can be stolen or lost.
- **Medium** - only conditionally incentivized attack vector, but still relatively likely.
- **Low** - has too many or too unlikely assumptions or requires a huge stake by the attacker with little or no incentive.

### Actions required by severity level

- **High** - client **must** fix the issue.
- **Medium** - client **should** fix the issue.
- **Low** - client **could** fix the issue.

# Findings





## Medium severity

## Issue 2: Unsafe ERC20 Token Transfers Using `.call()`
### Overview
In Solidity, using `.call()` to transfer ERC20 tokens is **not recommended** because it can fail for **non-standard ERC20 tokens** like USDT, BNB, and MKR. Some ERC20 tokens do not return a boolean (`true`) on `transfer()`, causing `.call()` to fail unexpectedly.  

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory data) = address(token).call(
    abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, tbalance)
);
if (!success || (data.length != 0 && !abi.decode(data, (bool)))) {
    revert TransferFailed();
}
```


### Why `.call()` is Problematic?
1. **Non-Standard ERC20 Behavior**  
   - Some tokens do not return a boolean (`true`) on `transfer()`.
   - `.call()` expects a return value and fails if the token does not provide it.

2. **Lack of Compatibility with Certain ERC20 Tokens**  
   - Tokens like **USDT, MKR, and BNB** do not strictly adhere to ERC20â€™s expected `transfer()` return value.
   - `.call()` will **fail on these tokens**.


### Recommended Fix:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

function withdrawStuckTokens(address token, address to) external onlyOwner {
    require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient");

    uint256 tbalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(tbalance > 0, "No token balance");

    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(token), to, tbalance);
}
```
### Resolution
Solved by removing `.call` function.




## Low Severity

## Issue 2: Lack of Validation in `updateTLWallet()` and `updateTaxWallet()` Functions (Already in known issues)**

### Overview
The `updateTLWallet()` and `updateTaxWallet()` functions allow the owner to change the treasury and tax wallet addresses. However, these functions **do not validate the new addresses**, which introduces potential risks.  


## Issue Details  
**Risk of Setting `address(0)` (Zero Address)**
- The contract **does not check** whether the new wallet address is `address(0)`.  
- If the owner mistakenly or maliciously sets the treasury or tax wallet to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, all future operations related to these wallets will **fail**.  


## Proposed Fix

**Add Input Validation in `updateTLWallet()`**
```solidity
function updateTLWallet(address newWallet) external onlyOwner {
    require(newWallet != address(0), "Invalid wallet address");
    require(newWallet != TLWallet, "New wallet must be different from the current one");
    
    TLWallet = newWallet;
    emit UpdatedTLWallet(newWallet);
}
```

 **Add Input Validation in `updateTaxWallet()`**
```solidity
function updateTaxWallet(address newWallet) external onlyOwner {
    require(newWallet != address(0), "Invalid tax wallet address");
    require(newWallet != taxWallet, "New wallet must be different from the current one");

    taxWallet = newWallet;
    emit UpdatedTaxWallet(newWallet);
}
```


### Resolution
Solved by addion 0 address check




## Gas Severity

## Issue 1: Cache array length outside of loop

## Overview:
In the `blockUsers` and `unblockUsers` function the array is not being cached before the loop and is being read froms memory on every ilteration so the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first))

### Resolution
Solved by caching the array outside the loop


## Issue 2: Nesting if-statements is cheaper than using &&

## Overview:

In `_update`, `enableRTFee` and `enableSFee` functions are using `And` condition which will consume more gas as compare to nested if-statement. Nesting if-statements avoids the stack operations of setting up and using an extra jumpdest, and saves 6 [gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/7f3b818abecfadbef93b894481ae7d19)
